The Pig Game in JavaScript is a simple dice game where two players compete to reach a set score (e.g., 100 points). 
Players take turns rolling a dice. Each roll adds to their round score, but if they roll a 1, they lose their round score, and it's the other player's turn. 
They can "hold" to add their round score to their total score. 
The game is implemented with JavaScript for the game logic, and HTML/CSS for the UI. 
It involves event handling, DOM manipulation, and basic game state management.
